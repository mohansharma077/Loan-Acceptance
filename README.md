# Loan-Acceptance
<h1>loan acceptance </h1>
<p>In machine learning, "loan acceptance" refers to the process of predicting whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on certain criteria and historical data. It involves developing a machine learning model that learns from past loan application data to make predictions on new, unseen loan applications.</p>
<p>To achieve loan acceptance prediction, a machine learning model is trained using a labeled dataset that includes features such as applicant information, credit history, income, employment details, and other relevant factors. The model learns patterns and relationships from this training data to classify future loan applications as either accepted or rejected.</p>
